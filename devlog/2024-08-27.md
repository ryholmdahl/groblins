## Where we're starting

We have a Groblin who can land on blocks and, when his food need takes priority, run towards the nearest food in vision range.

## Goals for today

Get the Groblin to jump over blocks to reach his target. Initial procedural generation of maps.

## What we did

- Got the Groblin to jump when there is a block in his path to the target.
- Added sine-based generation of maps.
- Objects were clipping through the first layer of the map and sticking to the second, but only when there are multiple layers. This is because the object was colliding with both as it clips through the first, but the bottom block's collision interaction was checked first. This moved the Groblin to be landed on the bottom block, which would cause there to be no collision with the top block. I fixed this by adding an "exposed" parameter for each side of the block, so collision only gets checked when a side is exposed. The check for exposure still needs to be optimized.
