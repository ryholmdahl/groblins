## Where we're starting

The Groblin can move towards the nearest food on a randomly-generated map and jump over blocks to get there.

## Goals for today

- Add text displays of the Groblin's needs.
- Add some basic simulation elements:
  - Drop berries at a random interval and make sure the groblin collects them.
  - Adjust the sight range and add an "explore" plan to help the groblin find berries.

## What we did

- Added simple text to display info about Groblins next to their sprite.
- Found an issue where Groblins will clip through walls if they jump along them enough. Fixed by bouncing Groblins off the walls so they don't inch their way through the wall.
- Changed the move plan to only change x velocity if the Groblin is landed. This exposed an issue where the Groblin is landed only on some frames, which caused it to only experience drag on occasional frames.
- I need to figure out movement. I think I want to let Groblins climb any walls.
