## Where we're starting

We're stuck on better pathing for the Groblin. I'm trying to use a pathing algorithm to get the Groblin to cling to walls, but getting him to the wall that enables that space to be entered is challenging.

### Known TO-DOs:

- Can't access objects peeking over the edge of a cliff because they're considered inaccessible
- If Groblin has a path to a food that becomes inaccessible, it won't update its path.

## Goals for today

- Pathing along walls.

## What we did

- I confirmed that the pathfinding itself is working as intended.
- What do we want movement to be like?
  - Groblin can scale along any wall. This gives full access to the map. Is that what we want?
  - Groblin can climb out of caves and jump over small walls. This creates inaccessible areas.
- I ended up switching back to jump-based movement instead of climbing, but still using A\* to determine the path.
- Question: should things like pathing live in the needs?
  - The need tracker needs to know if the food it's going for is inaccessible. Therefore, it seems like it should need to know the path.
  - But this violates the "tracker says what it wants and the world executes it" mentality. Maybe that's fine?
- Moved pathing to the tracker so that it won't plan to go for inaccessible food.
- Fixed clipping when descending corners by switching the order of landed checks.
- Added some simple caves to the map with cellular automata.
- Needed to re-add exploring. This is tricky because we only want to explore if we have a viable path, but figuring out where the Groblin can feasibly explore is difficult.
- Next goal: let the player add blocks to unblock the Groblin.
- TODO: cleanup plan code
