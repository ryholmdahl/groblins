## Where we're starting

The Groblin is using jump-based pathfinding to get around. There's some simple explore logic but it probably needs to be cleaned up -- for instance, the Groblin can get stuck if it lands on the edge of a block, because it's probably checking pathing. The code is also chaotic right now.

### Known TO-DOs:

- Can't access objects peeking over the edge of a cliff because they're considered inaccessible
- If Groblin has a path to a food that becomes inaccessible, it won't update its path.
- Lag over time
- Objects clipping through the floor at high speeds

## Goals for today

Code cleanup and really solidify the movement logic.

## What we did

- Cleanup up Groblin's pathing / explore logic in the need tracker
- Updated velocities to use the time delta
- Revamped collision logic to reduce "getting stuck"
