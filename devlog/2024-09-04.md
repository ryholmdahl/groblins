## Where we're starting

The Groblin is using jump-based pathfinding to get around and exploring pretty consistently.

### Known TO-DOs:

- Can't access objects peeking over the edge of a cliff because they're considered inaccessible
- ~If Groblin has a path to a food that becomes inaccessible, it won't update its path.~
- Lag over time
- Objects clipping through the floor at high speeds?
- ~Still giving up on exploring too early~
- Wonky-looking movement in caves
- Huge jump when Groblin jumps to the right with a block to the upper left

## Goals for today

Allow the player to add a block and cause the Groblin to reassess its path. Add traversable caves.

## What we did

- Add pointer events that create and remove blocks on click
- Added traversable caves
- Prevented Groblin from moving kitty-corner through walls
- Stopped Groblin from giving up on exploring too early
- Switched to using Cursor as my IDE
