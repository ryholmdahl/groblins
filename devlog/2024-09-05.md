## Where we're starting

The Groblin is using jump-based pathfinding to get around and exploring pretty consistently.

### Known TO-DOs:

- Can't access objects peeking over the edge of a cliff because they're considered inaccessible
- Lag over time
  - Somewhat addressed by 2D partitioning
- Objects clipping through the floor at high speeds?
- Wonky-looking movement in caves
- ~Jittering between landed and floating when berry falls on a raised block~
- ~Huge jump when Groblin jumps to the right with a block to the upper left~
- Groblins might slip off of a cliff and be unable to get back up
- ~checkExposure is slow; should only update as necessary~
- Do we need the "collidable" component?

## Goals for today

- Fix the huge jump
- Roadmap of next steps

## What we did

- Fixed the huge jump -- it was caused by the Groblin's velocity being multiplied instead of set when colliding with the underside of a block
- Refactored the component code to use interfaces instead of types; this required a lot of downstream changes
- Added keyboard events to pan the map
- Confirmed working for multiple Groblins
- Used transparency to show the Groblin's vision range
- Made a bunch of optimizations to fight lag with bigger maps:
  - Created EntityCollection, which makes extracting entities by component(s) faster. Could still use caching
  - Added 2D partitioning to speed up collision checking and vision checking
  - checkExposure will only look in the neighborhood of where the change was made
- Thought a bit about the game loop:
  - Goal is to...
    - Build a big shrine?
    - Survive?
    - Find some treasure?
  - Use indirect powers to get your Groblins to do stuff
    - Might use fear, might use incentives, maybe a skill tree of powers?
- Key milestones to hit:
  - Multiple Groblins
  - More needs
    - Social -- be near other Groblins
    - Rest -- do nothing
    - Safety -- be away from monsters
    - Curiosity -- go exploring
  - Monsters
  - Buildings
  - More powers
  - Groblins can manipulate terrain
  - Groblin goals
