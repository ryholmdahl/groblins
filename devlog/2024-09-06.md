## Where we're starting

The Groblin is using jump-based pathfinding to get around and exploring pretty consistently.

### Known TO-DOs:

- Can't access objects peeking over the edge of a cliff because they're considered inaccessible
- Objects clipping through the floor eventually
- Wonky-looking movement in caves
- Groblins might slip off of a cliff and be unable to get back up
- ~Do we need the "collidable" component?~

## Goals for today

- Revisit new components and clean up
- Add a monster

## What we did

- Moved partition logic to a new class
