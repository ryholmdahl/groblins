## Where we're starting

Things are generally pretty efficient. There isn't really gameplay to speak of, and there's still some frustrating jankiness with movement (see "Known TO-DOs" below).

### Known TO-DOs:

- Can't access objects peeking over the edge of a cliff because they're considered inaccessible
- ~Objects clipping through the floor eventually~
  - Maybe resolved?
- ~Wonky-looking movement in caves~
- Groblins might slip off of a cliff and be unable to get back up
- Groblins don't move smoothly off of cliff edges
- ~Groblins might jump constantly to access a berry on a high post~
  - Maybe this is because they don't resassess the route as they go? Maybe do this on a timer?
  - Seems like it was an issue with grid updating.
- ~Exploration is kinda shitty, won't go through big caves~
- ~Super lag on huge map as groblins get near the ground~
- ~Lag when a groblin is moving near a cave on a big map?~
  - It isn't actually this, it's just having too many foods within vision range but not accessible; it tries to route to all of them!
  - I tried adding a timer to prevent constant checking for food, but this just causes a stutter every few frames
  - I added a cache of already-checked foods to prevent redundant pathfinding that resets when the grid is updated
- Updating the grid causes a small lag
- Maybe related to above: deciding a new explore path is slow because it checks every space within vision range (updating the grid might be re-triggering the pathfinding)

## Goals for today

- Figure out why objects might clip through the floor
- Make cave movement smoother
- Randomized properties of groblins

## What we did

- Added a small offset to the y position when checking for block collisions. Also added a max delta time to the tick function to prevent massive jumps when the framerate drops. Maybe this will fix clipping through the floor?
- Moved vision and speed to be properties of the groblin, and made them slightly randomized.
- Changed explore behavior; instead of just looking for an open nearby space, the groblin will look for the farthest-away open space in vision range and in the explore direction. This produces much better exploring, including cave diving.
- Fixed some issues with the pathfinding grid not being correctly updated when new blocks are added
- Re-added pathfinding sprites, which are really helpful for debugging
- Improved performance significantly, allowing for bigger maps
  - Groblins won't keep trying to route to inaccessible foods
  - Sprite pooling to only show what's on-screen
  - Fixed and optimized grid update logic
