## Where we're starting

Efficiency is pretty good. Framerate will eventually tank with enough objects in close proximity, mostly caused by the collision check logic. Still no gameplay.

### Known TO-DOs:

- Can't access objects peeking over the edge of a cliff because they're considered inaccessible
- Groblins might slip off of a cliff and be unable to get back up
- Groblins don't move smoothly off of cliff edges
- Updating the grid causes a small lag
- ~Groblins can route across the whole map to reach anything within vision~

## Goals for today

- Add a profiler to identify performance bottlenecks
- Start working toward playability

## What we did

- Added a profiler, which identified that collision checking is the main perfomance bottleneck (~85% of time). 57% is spent on checking intersecting neighbors, and 28% is spent on identifying the neighborhood.
- Tried adding "rough" neighborhood detection, which does not check the distance between the neighbors, just the partition. This cut down on the time spent in that part; with total at 85%, 72% is spent on intersection checks and 6.6% is spent on identifying the neighborhood. Though this might be because more intersections are being checked?
  - With rough: hit 98% tick time @ 368 entities
  - W/o rough: hit 98% tick time @ 378 entities
  - So it doesn't help. Remove it.
- Tried making the neighborhood logic more efficient, returning an array instead of a set. Hit 98% tick time @ 380 entities. So no help there either.
- Tried setting grid size to 1, but that leads to jittery collisions.
- I'm probably wasting time on this. How often will this many entities be stacked right on top of each other?
  - I tried spreading the berries over the whole map. This revealed that groblin plan setting is super laggy, seemingly when the groblin switches explore direction. This may be because the groblin is stuck in a small space with a lot of verticality.
  - Fixed this by using a different pathfinding algorithm for explore, where instead of checking against a bunch of different destinations, just look for the farthest position from the groblin that is walkable.
- Even with the objects spread out, the collision detection is taking too long. I think this is because we're doing N^2 checks, instead of just looking neighborhood by neighborhood. Will it improve if we iterate over occupied partitions instead of each object?
  - It improved somewhat. We're still wasting a lot of time checking on collisions for objects that haven't moved.
  - Really, what we want to do is check collisions only in neighborhoods where something has moved.
  - After doing this, lag is much less of an issue.
- z-indexing sprites
- Berries spawning at open positions instead of in the sky
- Raise the peak terrain height
